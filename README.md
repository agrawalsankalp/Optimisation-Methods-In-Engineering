# Optimisation-Methods-In-Engineering

This Project is a part of course ME609 Optimisation Methods in Engineering. 

This script helps to optimise Uni-Variate and Multi-Variate functions and plot the graph of convergence to Minima or Maxima using Python. 

Methods Covered yet in the Script:
1. `Bounding Phase Method`.
2. `Interval Halving Method`. 

More methods will be updated later on.
